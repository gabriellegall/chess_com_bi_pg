    description: "
      This test ensures that stockfish has processed and evaluated the expected number of moves, for all games loaded in the datawarehouse. 
      This test could fail for several reasons:
      (1) some games have been loaded, but the games moves are not yet evaluated (severity = low)
      (2) There are some duplicate records in the games moves table (severity = medium) 
      (3) Stockfish has not evaluated all moves (severity = high)
